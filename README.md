# OpenCamp NextGen Conference
On Saturday, July 9, 2016, David Liedle and Sylvain Guittard taught an introductory course on HTML and CSS at the NextGen session at the OpenCamp at the United Nations Headquarters in NYC. This repository contains the code, in its final form, which was written together with the students during that session.
